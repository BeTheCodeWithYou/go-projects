This application is basic implementaion of decoding morse code. It also allows you to encode a plain text into the morse code.

App is built using **htmx**, jquery and golang having api end points & used go templates.

The Morse code encodes every character as a sequence of "dots" and "dashes".
For example, the letter A is coded as ·−, letter Q is coded as −−·−, and digit 1 is coded as ·−−−−.

The Morse code is case-insensitive, traditionally capital letters are used.

When the message is written in Morse code, a single space is used to separate the character codes and 3 spaces are used to separate words.

For example, the message HEY JUDE in Morse code is ···· · −·−− ·−−− ··− −·· ·.
